/*You have a business with several offices; you want to lease phone lines to connect them up with each other;
and the phone company charges different amounts of money to connect different pairs of cities.
You want a set of lines that connects all your offices with a minimum total cost. Solve the problem by suggesting appropriate data structures.*/
